Hi! Isolation is shit. This might help you!

Basically, I'm trying to do a somewhat domain-driven application about cards and games and card games and it's a discord bot.

I'm doing this more as a small personal challenge than anything else.

## Running this project locally

First, you are going to need to set your bot's token in your env vars (see [run.py](run.py)).

### Install dependencies

```shell script
pipenv install
```

### Run application

```shell script
pipenv run python run.py
```

### Run tests

```shell script
pipenv run nose2 tests
```

### Lint code

```shell script
pipenv run pylint app tests
```
